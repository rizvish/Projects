# SNAproject
A massive collection of data on which a destructive algorithm runs to show highly connected networks and number of iterations taken to destroy the capital nodes until the graph is no longer considered a highly connected network. Java and Gephi are used to accomplish this.

Please refer to SocialNetworkAnalysis.docx for full detail on Analysis and project approach 

In the interationsJPG.jpg file, each image under original is the original copy of the data set loaded into gephi and each corresponding test from 1-5 are resulting images loaded into Gephi after running a java program to itertively destroy capital nodes/
