Simulation of OS

To run the project navigate to the src folder in the terminal/command line

compile the project using the following (although project is precompiled in file a.out)

g++ main.cpp Pcb.cpp ProcessStates.cpp Dispatcher.cpp FileGenerator.cpp

once compiled, run with the following command

./a.out

The program will ask if you will like to generate a new input file (used mostly for test cases)
If said no, then provide the input file in the correct format and input total number of processes

Next, the program will ask how many processes (tasks) will you like the generate if said yes to previous question

Either watch how the processes are handled in each iteration using Round Robin Algorithm or hit a single non 1 number to proceed manually
